Closures - unit of work
Closures - store the scope

Defining them - Return, ^Name, Parameters - void(^)()
Typedef
Memory issues - copy, not retain. 

No Beachball - run something in the background + call back to main?
Invalidation Pattern - Postpone tasks for the run loop. 
Asynchronous Services - replacing a @selector

Code reuse (for loops)
Factories - iPad vs iPhone cells?
SDK - enumerators
SDK - sort
SDK - animations - shows how it's useful to keep scope around
Queuing up expensive tasks, then canceling them
Concurrency - blocks in a queue always execute sequentially?
